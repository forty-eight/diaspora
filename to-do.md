## To-dos

- Figure out how to add text over the planet (so we can show number of units)
- ~~Check for collisions before randomly placing planets, we don't want them to overlap~~
- Need a players model
- neutral color
- starfield bg
- hud at top of screen

- how to play instructions <-- add this to the readme
- fixed canvas width
- auto generate opponents on modal
- write up about the tech

- maybe blur circles: http://www.w3schools.com/tags/canvas_shadowblur.asp

known bugs
- planet colors come from firebase so they don't necessarily reflect the color shown on the lobby modal
- when you reload it fires all previous comets (this is kind of fixed, comets are deleted)
